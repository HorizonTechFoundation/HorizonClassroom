# HORIZON CLASSROOM

**An innovative classroom engagement app by Horizon Tech Foundation**  
**Built with Flutter (Frontend) + Django (Backend)**

## 🎯 Purpose

**Horizon Classroom** is a mobile-first solution designed to minimize distractions during class or test hours. By enforcing in-app presence, the app automatically tracks student attention. If a student closes or minimizes the app, they are instantly **marked as absent**—encouraging full participation and minimizing mobile misuse.
